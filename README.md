# Node.js connector for the Shopify API [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/Shopfrogs/Nodify.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/Shopfrogs/Nodify)
***
Talk to Shopify API speaking node!

Besides of hooking up to the whole Shopify API, this connector does authentication for your app with any Shopify store. Billing and sample data is also provided.

### Installation

    # 1
    # 2
    # 3

### Usage

    # 1

If you don't have the API key and Shared Secret yet, sign up for a [Shopify Partner account](https://app.shopify.com/services/partners/signup/), and create your first app. You can also create test stores
once you're logged in as a partner.

When you create your app in the Shopify Partner Account, set the return URL to
<tt>tba</tt>

You can also create a private application that only works for your store by
visiting https://YOUR-SHOP.myshopify.com/admin/api

We deeply explain how to work with Proxy to help Shopify do more brand awareness and to give user a stronger feel that he's working inside his Shopify admin panel. (Carlos, any help?)

### Example

    # 1

This will create the Nodify environment with sample views.

### After running the generator

First, start your application:

    # how to start the node connector

Head over to: http://localhost:3000 (or whichever we call it) and enter the url of your Shopify store.

After your application has been given read or read/write API permission by the
store, you're ready to start experimenting with the Shopify API.
